            <h3>Version 1.22.0</h3>
            <b>Shortcut Placement / Using in Other Apps</b><br>
            You may have encountered a problem when trying to use shortcuts in other apps (e.g. Tasker), where it would not select or make the other app crash. There is now an alternative method of selecting a shortcut that you may try in this case. Simply retry selecting the shortcut and you will be prompted with a dialog that asks you to pick either the new or the old method.
            <br><br>
            <b>Longer Timeouts</b><br>
            It is now possible to have request timeouts of up to 10 minutes.

            <b>Shortcut Actions</b><br>
            You can now define what happens before and after a shortcut is executed. This includes things like displaying a Toast message, extracting part of the response or triggering another shortcut. More to come in future updates!
            <br><br>
            <b>Support for multipart/form-data</b><br>
            In addition to sending a custom request body and simple parameters, it is now also possible to send form data, i.e, using the "multipart/form-data" content type.
            <br><br>

            <h3>Version 1.20.0</h3>
            <b>Simplified Variable Insertion</b><br>
            Inserting variables into shortcuts has now become much easier. Each input field that supports variables now has a button next to it. Clicking it opens a popup dialog with a list of all available variables, allowing you to easily pick and insert one.
            <br><br>
            <b>Improved Tasker Integration</b><br>
            When triggering shortcuts from Tasker, it is now possible to send along variables. Simply define variables with the same name in Tasker as in your shortcut and their value will automatically be sent from Tasker to your shortcut when triggered.
            <br><br>
            <b>Drag & Drop Reordering</b><br>
            Categories & Variables, as well as options of <i>select</i> & <i>toggle</i> variables, can now easily be reordered via drag & drop.
            <br><br>
            <b>Improved Specification of Request Body</b><br>
            When specifying the request body of a shortcut, you now have the option to chose between <i>x-www-form-urlencoded</i>, i.e., the body is a list of parameters, or <i>custom text</i>, i.e., you specify the request body as raw text and give it a content-type.
            <br><br>
            <b>Variables within Variables!</b><br>
            The <i>constant</i>, <i>toggle</i> and <i>select</i> variable types now support recursive resolution of values. This means you can reference other variables from these variables. For example, you could set up a <i>select</i> variable where one of the options is a <i>color</i> variable.
            <br><br>
            <b>Miscellaneous</b>
            <ul>
                <li>The input field for request parameter values now allows multiline input.</li>
                <li>The cURL export dialog now includes a <i>copy</i> button to allow you to quickly copy the cURL command to the clipboard.</li>

        <p>
            <b>What are variables?</b><br>
            Variables allow you to inject pieces of information dynamically into your shortcuts when executing them. A variable consists of a key and a value which is resolved at execution time, based on its type. For some variable types this means that a prompt dialog is shown that asks for a value, others can be resolved without user input.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>How do I use variables?</b><br>
            You can insert a placeholder for a variable into your shortcuts\' url, requests parameters, request body, authentication and header fields by clicking the \"{ }\" button next to the input field and selecting a variable.
        </p>
        <p>
            When executing a shortcut that contains variable placeholders all of them are resolved according to their type.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also insert these placeholders into some of your variables, i.e., you can have variables reference other variables.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>What are the different types of variables?</b><br>
            There are 10 different types of variables:</p>
        <p>
            <u>Constant</u><br>
            A <i>constant</i> stores a value, until explicitly changed. There is no prompt dialog. It can be used to store a piece of information that is shared across multiple shortcut, such as an authentication token or a domain name. This way it can easily be changed.<br>
            There are also certain actions that can be attached to a shortcut that allow you to change the value of a constant, e.g., by storing part of the HTTP response into it.
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>Toggle</u><br>
            The <i>toggle</i> type consists of a list of values. There is no prompt dialog. Every time it is used it resolves to the next value in the list. When the last value is reached it starts again from the first.
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>Selection</u><br>
            The <i>selection</i> type consists of a list of options, each of which has a value and a label. It triggers a dialog from which one of the options can be selected.
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>Text, Number and Password</u><br>
            The <i>text</i>, <i>number</i> and <i>password</i> types trigger a prompt dialog where a value can be entered into a text field.
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>Number Slider</u><br>
            The <i>number slider</i> type is similar to the <i>number</i>. It allows you to pick a number. However, the number is entered using a horizontal slider, for which you can define the minimum and maximum value, as well as the step size.
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>Date and Time</u><br>
            The <i>date</i> and <i>time</i> types trigger a prompt dialog where a date or time can be selected. The output format can be specified according to Android\'s <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html">SimpleDateFormat</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>Color</u><br>
            The <i>color</i> type triggers a prompt dialog where a color can be selected. Its value is returned in RGB hex format (e.g. ff0000 for red).
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>What does <i>Allow \'Share ‚Ä¶\'</i> mean?</b><br><b>How can I share text into variables?</b><br>
            In the advanced settings section of a variable you can mark it as <i>Allow \'Share ‚Ä¶\'</i>. This makes it possible to provide the value of this variable through Android\'s <i>Share</i>-dialog, e.g. by sharing a URL or text snippet from another app. The variable will then assume the shared value during execution.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>General</b><br>
            All data entered into the app is only ever sent to the domains specified by the user through the use of shortcuts. No data about the user, their behavior or device is ever collected or sent to the developer or any other third-party as part of this app.<br><br>The only exception to this is crash reporting (see below).
        </p>
        <p><b>Crash Reporting</b><br>
            The app uses the third-party library Bugsnag to collect crash reports. This serves the purpose of discovering and fixing bugs in the app. The collected data contains basic information about the device and the type of crash. No personal information such as usernames, email addresses or IP addresses is collected.<br><br>The user has the option to opt-out of the sending of these crash reports.
